## 4: (Problem 2.14.4) GF2 Vector Addition A
# Please express your solution as a subset of the letters {'a','b','c','d','e','f'}.
# For example, {'a','b','c'} is the subset consisting of:
#   a (1100000), b (0110000), and c (0011000).
# The answer should be an empty set, written set(), if the given vector u cannot
# be written as the sum of any subset of the vectors a, b, c, d, e, and f.

# Use the same format as the previous problem
